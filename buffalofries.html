   <h2>The Delicious, Unstoppable Goodness</h2>
   <p>Look, who doesn't love buffalo fries? They're buffalo and they're fries,
      they can even be vegan! (But they probably shouldn't be, if I'm being
      honest.)
   </p>

   <h2>Ingredients</h2>
   <ul>
       <li>1 (28-ounce) bag frozen french fries</li>
       <li>1 (24-ounce) bag frozen boneless buffalo chicken bites</li>
       <li>1 (8-ounce) package shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
       <li>1/3 cup ranch dressing</li>
   </ul>

   <h2>Steps</h2>
   <ol>
       <li>Cook the french fries and chicken bites according to the package instructions.</li> 
       <li>Coarsely chop the chicken bites.</li>
       <li>Spread the french fries on an oven-safe platter.  Sprinkle with about half of the cheese.  Top with the chopped chicken bites.  Then sprinkle with the remaining cheese.  Return to the oven at 350Â°F for about 5 minutes or until the cheese melts.</li>  
       <li>Drizzle with the ranch dressing and serve.</li>
   </ol>
