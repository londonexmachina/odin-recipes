   <h2>Cholesterol Attack!</h2>
   <p>My first love in life, and hopefully one of yours,
       brought to you by national heroes Outback Steakhouse
       and... Texas Roadhouse? Yeah, I guess.
   </p>

   <h2>Ingredients</h2>
   <ul>
       <li>2 MEDIUM Russet Potatoes</li>
       <li>6 Cups Vegetable Oil ; for fries</li>
       <li>1 Tablespoon Salt</li>
       <li>1 teaspoon Garlic Powder</li>
       <li>3/4 teaspoon ground black powder</li>
       <li>1/2 teaspoon Onion Powder</li>
       <li>1/8 teaspoon ground thyme</li>
       <li>1 cup shredded monteray jack</li>
       <li>1 cup shredded cheddar</li>
       <li>1 slice Bacon Cooked, crumbled</li>
   </ul>

   <h2>Steps</h2>
   <ol>
       <li>For the Aussie Chips: Preheat oil to 375(F) degrees in a deep fryer.</li> 
       <li>Cut potatoes into french fry slices using a vegetable slicer or mandolin. Its important to use a gadget for the slicing so that the fries will all be the same thickness, and will cook evenly. Submerge all of the sliced potatoes in a large bowl fill with cold water for 30 minutes.</li>
       <li>Combine all of the seasoning ingredients in a small bowl and set aside.</li>  
       <li>Remove potato slices from the water and onto a clean towel. Blot dry.</li>
       <li>Fry potato slices for 8 to 12 minutes in hot oil until light brown. Drain fries on a rack or paper towels and sprinkle with some of the seasoning. Pile the fries on a plate and serve with ranch dressing on the side, if desired.</li>
       <li>For the Aussie Cheese Fries: Prepare the clone for the Aussie Chips and arrange the seasoned fries on an oven-safe plate. Preheat oven to 400 degrees.</li>
       <li>Mix the cheeses together and sprinkle the blend over the fries. Crumble the bacon and sprinkle it over the cheese. Bake the plate for 4 to 5 minutes in the hot oven, until cheese is melted. Serve with ranch dressing on the side.</li>
