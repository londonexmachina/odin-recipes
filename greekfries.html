   <h2>The Taste of Ameriterranean</h2>
   <p>Mediterranean food is supposed to be healthy, so let's just America
       that whole thing up and load them down with enough of everything to
       make you beg for mercy by the time you've finished your plate.

       <li>Preheat an air fryer to 380Â°F. Coat the basket with cooking spray.</li> 
       <li>Cut each potato lengthwise into 1/4-inch-thick slices; cut each slice into 1/4-inch fries.</li>
